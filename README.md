# AGILE Security
> To run an example you should use the details mentioned below inside the [Setup a Running Example](#getrunning) section.

## Introduction

Agile Security offers an oauth2 server which in turn can rely on third party Identity Providers (IdPs) to authenticate users in AGILE.
Currently, Agile Security supports the authorization code flow of Oauth2. As a result, every application acting as an Oauth2 client (using Agile Security as identity provider), must be first registered with Agile Security. To have a quick set-up running with a registered Oauth2 client please check the OAuth client example referenced below.

Another option is to not only use Agile Security as an identity provider, but also to use its capabilities to manage and register entities. For developers interested in this, the "api-client" branch of the oauth2-example contains an express web application, with a demo graphical user interface, that executes the REST calls to the REST Entity API when the user uses the browser to do basic operations on identities, such as reading, creation of entities, updating attributes, etc.

Agile Security has several submodules. Among them, are the agile-pdp, agile-idm-core.  
The main responsibilities of Agile Security are the following:

* **Oauth2 provider**: Agile Security implements the authorization code grant of Oauth2. In turn, Agile Security can still use external identity providers such as google, github, or even the local operating system to authenticate users, depending on its configuration. This allows the AGILE framework and potentially other applications to rely on it to handle the authentication of their users.
* **User registration**:: Agile Security also handles the user registration and management. In this way only certain users are allowed to login in the gateway. This is of utmost importance when Agile Security relies on external identity providers, because otherwise any user with a valid account in the external identity provider would be able to log in.
* **Entity registration**: Agile Security is used to register entities, such as sensors, oauth2 clients, workflows, etc. This forms the basis for policy enforcement.
* **Entites' attributes management**: Agile Security allows users to manage their entity's attributes. It implements write and read policies on the data to provide attribute asurance, which then allows for the implementation of a wide range of access control mechanisms, such as role based access control among others.
* **Entity lookup**:  Agile Security allows users to lookup entities. To this end, users can provide a set of constraints specifying attribute name and value.
* **Entity attribute declasification**: Agile Security also declassifies attributes that are not readable by users that query IDM. For example, there may be certain attributes that can only be read by the entity owner, but not by the rest of the users.
* **Credential Management**: Thanks to the entity declassification functionality of Agile Security, it could configured to allow entities to store credentials (that are used to connect to external clouds or systems for example). Provided that the right policies are configured, IDM would only return this information to the entities allowed to read this information, e.g. the owner of the entity.
* **Group Management**: To simplify the policy definition for developers, users can define groups and add entities to them. This can provide an easy way to handle entities and to define security policies for them by referencing the group directly.

## Modules included in this repository

* **AGILE Audit**: This component manages the events generated by the Policy Decision Point for auditing access to devices and actuators in the AGILE Gateway
* **AGILE IDM Core**: takes care of validating the schema of entities, and to apply policies whenever attributes for policies are change or read. For storage, the agile-idm-entity-storage component is used.
* **AGILE IDM Etity Storage**: This module uses a leveldb storage and transactions to handle entities in AGILE Identity Management. This module is required in the agile-idm-web component (to validate client secrets), and it is also used by agile-idm-core, also inside agile-idm-web to store entities.
* **AGILE Policies**
* **AGILE Upfront Modules**
* **AGILE Upfront Locks**
* **Passport Webid**


## <a name="getrunning"></a>Setting up a Running Example

### Oauth2 Client
Given that a client is required, we provide two examples that can be used to build upon and get started using Agile Security.
To get a minimalistic example running with IDM, it is required to clone the "client" branch of the oauth2-example of idm located here (https://github.com/nopbyte/agile-idm-oauth2-client-example).

### Quick Start

To run this component you need lerna which is a tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.

If you haven't used lerna bevore start by installing Lerna globally with npm (`Lerna 2.x` is the recommended version)
```shell
npm install --global lerna
```

Afterwards you will be able to link all local packages together and install the remaining package dependencies with
```shell
lerna bootstrap
```

Now you can start the agile-security component with running the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

Afterwards, you will have a version of agile-security running in port 3000 in both cases. However, you still need to have an application to rely on agile-security as an IdP or as a PDP.  For this, please check our [samples](https://github.com/nopbyte/agile-security-samples) 

### <a name="runmongodb"></a>Run with MongoDB
To be able to use MongoDB as the database for our AGILE-Security component we can set the `database` config variable inside the `./packages/agile-securiy/package.json`.
```json
"config": {
  "agile": {
    ...
    "database": "mongodb"
  },
  ...
},
```
Now you can either use your own MongoDB installation or run the following docker container.
```yaml
version: '3'

services:

  mongo:
    container_name: mongo
    image: mongo:3.2.15
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: agile
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
    ports:
      - 27017:27017/tcp
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./mongo/db/:/data/db
    command: mongod --auth
```

If you need to debug or check if everything gets stored correctly inside the MongoDB database you can connect via the mongo cli client. Herefore use the following command:
```shell
mongodb://agile:secret@localhost:27017/admin
```

For more informations about the use of MongoDB inside of AGILE-Security you can have a look [here](/packages/agile-security/docs/MongoDB.md).

## Debug mode

If you define the `idm_web`  inside the `./packages/agile-securiy/package.json` as the following this module will print debugging information to stdout, and in case of exceptions, it will print the stack trace in the browser.

```json
"config": {
  ...
  "debug": {
    "idm_web": 0,
    "idm_core": 0,
    "idm_storage": 0
  }
},
```

If no variable is set, or if any other value different than 1 is set, this component runs in quiet mode.

To debug the agile-idm-core or the agile-idm-storage components that are within agile-security please set the config variables `idm_core`  or `idm_storage` to 1 respectively. These two components will log to stdout debugging information.

## Testing

### Run predefined test set
To run the test of `agile-security` and `agile-idm-core` you can execute
```shell
npm test
```
inside the root folder.  
This will execute the tests for level-db an mongo-db inside those two packages.

> !!! You need to have a running instance of MongoDB. Have a look here: [Setup a MongoDB Container](#runmongodb) !!! 


### Run all defined tests
To run all the defined tests inside the packages you can simply run
```shell
lerna run test
```
inside the root folder.  
This will execute all defined `npm test` scripts inside the packages.

> !!! Currently not all tests are passed. This may be due to tests that have not been adapted for working with MongoDB or other problems that have been fixed. !!!

## Main open source projects used by Agile Security

Although Agile Security has more dependencies, the key open source components used are the following:

* **Express**: This framework is used as the basis for building the Agile Security web server. Along with express several middlewares were used to cope with body parsing, sesion handling, etc.
* **Passport**: Passport is an authentication framework with a live ecosystem of pluggins contributed by the open source community. It has been used to implement the athentication mechanisms used by Agile Security.
* **Oauth2-orize**: This framework uses passport to facilitate the construction of an Oauth2 server.
* **LevelDB**: LevelDB provides a lightweight key value database used by Agile Security and its submodules to store tokens, antities and groups.
* **UPFROnt**: the ULock Policy FRamewOrk (UPFRont) is used to support usage locks to apply enforcement to write and read actions on attributes.
* **Lerna**: A tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.
